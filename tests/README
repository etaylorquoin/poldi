README for pam-test
===================

  Usage: pam-test [options] <PAM service name>
  Test PAM authentication.
  
  Options:
   -h, --help      print help information
   -v, --version   print version information
   -u, --username  specify username for authentication
  
  Report bugs to <moritz@gnu.org>.

pam-test is a small utility suitable for testing authentication
through PAM. pam-test is not Poldi specific at all; rather it's a
generic tool for testing authentication through PAM.

PAM authentication methods are identified by a "service name"
(e.g. "su", "login", "gdm"). Testing authentication is thus only a
matter of typing:

  $ ./pam-test SERVICENAME

Testing Poldi authentication can be achieved by defining a new service
name "poldi" using pam_poldi.so and then typing:

  $ ./pam-test poldi

This is how a successful run looks like:

  $ ./pam-test poldi
  Waiting for card...
  Trying authentication as user `moritz'...
  Authentication succeeded
  Authenticated as user `moritz'
  $ 

Have fun.



README for session-test
===================
  Usage: run-pam-session-test.sh [options] <user name>
  Test PAM authentication.
  
  Options:
   -h, --help      print help information
   -v, --version   print version information
   
   This test must be ran with an account that will have permission
   to access the gpg and scdaemon sockets created for the user
   specified in the command. To ensure a proper test you will need
   to send the SIGTERM signal to any gpg-agent and scdeamon processes
   running under the user.
   
   You will need to update the path in the ./services/other folder to
   point to the pam_poldi.so module you are testing.
   
   session-test is a utility used to test the session component 
   of the poldi module. It requires the libpamtest library found 
   in the libpam-wrapper library and a properly 
   configured openpgp card/usb key. 
   
   session-test is invoked using the script run-pam-session-test.sh
   This is becuase libpamtest needs to preload a wrapper around libpam.
   libpamtest also requires exec privileges in the directory /tmp
   
   session-test sets the following exit values to indicate run status:
   
    PAMTEST_ERR_OK:           0
    PAMTEST_ERR_START:        1
	PAMTEST_ERR_CASE:         2
	PAMTEST_ERR_OP:           3
	PAMTEST_ERR_END:          4
	PAMTEST_ERR_KEEPHANDLE:   5
	
	unknown error             all other postiive numbers
	
	Success is indicated by an exit status of 0
