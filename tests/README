pam-test is a small utility suitable for testing authentication
through PAM. pam-test is not Poldi specific at all; rather it's a
generic tool for testing authentication through PAM.

PAM authentication methods are identified by a "service name"
(e.g. "su", "login", "gdm"). Testing authentication is thus only a
matter of typing:

  $ ./pam-test SERVICENAME

Testing Poldi authentication can be achieved by defining a new service
name "poldi" using pam_poldi.so and then typing:

  $ ./pam-test poldi

This is how a successful run looks like:

  $ ./pam-test poldi
  Waiting for card...
  Trying authentication as user `moritz'...
  Authentication succeeded
  Authenticated as user `moritz'
  $ 

Have fun.
