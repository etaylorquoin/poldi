# This is the database used by Poldis "local database" authentication
# method.  Syntax of this file is:
# 
#   This file consists of entries - one entry per line.
#   Entries are of the form: "<SERIALNO><WHITESPACES><USERNAME>\n"
#   (without quotation marks and without angle brackets.  Allowed
#   whitespaces are spaces and tabs.  <SERIALNO> is the serial number
#   of an OpenPGP smartcard.  It can be obtained by "gpg --card-status"
#   command as ``Application ID''.  <USERNAME> is a valid username on
#   the system.  Comments are opened with "#" and terminated by a newline.
#
# So, a valid entry would look like:
#   "D2760001240101010001000006550000	moritz"
